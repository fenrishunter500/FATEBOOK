When it comes to running a Magical Girl style game, while most of the general GMing tips and tricks out there are applicable there are a few key points you need to keep in mind. The genre is rife with many tropes that your players will expect to see. There are so many in fact it would be hard to list them all here. Instead, we are going to focus on some of the major ones and what that means for you, the GM, in the framework of your campaign. Check out the Magical Girl Tropes entry on tvtropes.org for a more comprehensive list than we are including here. 

## Subgenre
The first trope consideration that you need to decide on is which of the major subgenres are you wanting to play in. The three major subgenres can be described as the following:

**Cute Witch**, where magic is part of the mundane for the characters. In this type of game, their will be a heavier focus on the daily life part of being a Mahou than there will be battles. That is not to say that battles are not a part of Cure Witch media, but it is not the main focus. Cardcaptor Sakura and Little Witch Academia are both good examples of Cute Witch stories. 

**Magical Girl Warrior**, where Mahous take the role of super-heroines. This subgenre is almost synonymous with the Magical Girl genre in the West, and is more popular with the male demographic for it's shounen-levels of fight scenes. In the opinion of the author, it is also the easiest to translate to the game table with it's focus on battling over the day-to-day parts of Mahou life. As with Cute Witch, these aspects are still present in Magical Girl Warrior stories, however they tend to facilitate the build up to the next fight rather than stand on their own. There are many examples of this subgenre, for example Sailor Moon, Pretty Cure, and Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha. 

The last of the subgenres, **Deconstructive**, can be combined with either of the other two, or stand on its own. Deconstructive stories tend to run much darker then their lighter counterparts, aiming to subvert the expectations of the genre as a whole. Puella Magi Madoka Magica and Yuki Yuna is a Hero are two examples of this subgenre.

Deciding on which of these subgenres your story will fall under will inform you as to how things play out when you players do something unexpected. In a Cute Witch game, the consequences of not living up to the Magical Girl mantle are going to be less about the death and destruction of civilian lives, and more about the inner turmoil such a decision would bring with it, whereas in a Deconstructive game death, despair, and destruction are just par the course. 



## Genre Tropes
In addition to subgenre, there are tropes that are expected of the genre. In no particular order, here are a few that we feel are almost essential to properly running any Mahou Shoujo game. 

**Transformations.** Transformations are such a large trope that we have decided to give them their own mechanic in the form of Transformation Boons. However, there is more you can do with it if you so desire. Perhaps the characters need a specific item around in order to perform their transformation. Often times, the post-transformation outfit bears a color and theme in line with the magical powers it bestows. It's up to you and your players if these aspects are things you wish to emphasize on or not, but the recommendation from us is to at least make mention of these things in during your first Transformation Sequence.

**Guides/Mascots.** Another staple of the genre is the lovable team mascot, who often takes the form of a cute animal. This mascot is generally separate from any animal companions that are brought on by a Mahou's powers, but not always. Not all teams have the luxury of such a guide, however, and must bluster their way through their troubles without them. 

**Coming of Age Story.** At their core, Mahou Shoujo stories are generally coming of age stories. An exploration of development into maturity, and the troubles that adolescence brings, whether in the literal or metaphorical sense. This can be as overt or subtle as your story needs, but it is strongly encouraged that you include this on some level. 
A sub-trope of this is where the adults seem to be useless, unable to help in any substantial capacity. Only the adolescent Mahou Shoujo have the powers to defeat the monster, or perhaps by the power of their friendship can the team overcome the spell of the Big Bad. Speaking of...

**The Power of Friendship!** Often times, as a means of building dramatic tension, the team of girls succeed where a lone Mahou cannot. Furthermore, they cannot do so until they band together as a team, and tap into the innate power that their shared friendship holds. 

**Attack Names** More prevalent in battle heavy stories, naming attacks is a time-honored aspect of the genre. It is also fun, and serves to add another level of creativity for both players and GMs.

## ***Ideas***

Transformations

 - [x] New Stress [Purity] to represent resiliency to remaining in MG form
 - [x] Beginning of combat, roll a Magic check vs a TN to gain a one time bonus sometime during the fight.
 - [x] Bonus possibilities: Armor, a free invoke of an Aspect, a one time heal, etc.

Familiars

 - [x] Familiars: feature or choice? Do any MG ips have every girl with a familiar? Or just one per team? (GOING TO LEAVE UP TO TABLE)
 - [x] If one per team, does it belong to the team as a whole, or just one member a la Druid's Nature's Ally? (GOING TO LEAVE UP TO TABLE)

Limit Break

 - [x] LB should not be easy to tap into. Look into limitations. Transform back to normal? Major negatives to rolls? (NO, REPLACED WITH REVERTING AND TRANSFORMATION BOON)
 - [x] Possible limitation: Limit Break is only available to you if your Purity track is over half-way filled, or you currently have a Severe Purity Consequence on your sheet. (NO, REPLACED WITH REVERTING AND TRANSFORMATION BOON)

Magic Systems?

 - [x] Tianxia-style magical system? (NO, SKILL-BASED)
 - [x] Could Magic instead be an existing Stunt/Aspect, or a new additional one? (NO, SKILL-BASED)
 - [x] Relatedly, should magic be standardized (i.e. can only cast spells in book) or more Cinematically loose (and dependent on player's imagination?) (CINEMATICALLY LOOSE)
 - [x] In addition, new skill: Magic (FIGHT, SHOOT, UTILITY)

Colors?

 - [ ] Integral to genre, but does it need a mechanic? Does it need mentioning? Just a flavor note? (I THINK JUST A FLAVOR MENTION)

System Name

 - [x] Name for setting, a la Venture City? Some central ideal like Tianxia? Or something more base-line descriptive like Uranium Chef or Mecha v. Kaiju? (MAHOU SHOUJO: Wake Up, Go to School, Save the World)

Examples Needed

 - [x] New Set of applicable example stunts
 - [ ] Example M.G. should include a team, a duo, and a solo. If familiars are unique to a character, either the solo or the duo has her. Team should be thematic. Elements? Planets?
 - [x] Example M.G., do they need to be relatable to existing M.G. media, and if so, to whom? Sailor Moon, CC Sakura, Tokyo MM, Madoka? (RELATABLE, BUT NOT RIPPED OFF/FROM)
 - [x] Baddies. Who, what, how, why? Beastiary? (NO BEASTIARY, FOLLOWING THE ADVERSARY TOOLKIT)
 - [x] Baddies: Define Corruption levels. Equivalent to Power Level, but how? (BASED ON ENEMY CLASSIFICATION)
 - [x] If beastiary, provide stat blocks and multiple reskinnings of each stat block. I.e. brute (giant gorilla, wolf-man, bouncer-mook), scout (imp, eye guy, hufflepuffs), etc. (NO BEASTIARY)

Misc.

 - [x] Dice changes? Would necessitate standard 7 dice set vs. the 4dF of Fate. (NO. NEAT IDEA, BUT IMPRACTICAL HERE)
 - [x] Setting: Have one baked in, or no? If so, need to develop. (NO)
 - [ ] Intro module. A massive WANT but not necessarily a NEED
 - [ ] Fictions!
 - [ ] Art!
 - [ ] List of M.G. tropes and how to possibly utilize them
 - [ ] List of material for inspiration for games

Licensing

 - [x] Fate CC-BY w/ Powered By Fate logo preferred atm. 
 - [x] Other systems? I like Fate tho... (NO, NOT FOR NOW)

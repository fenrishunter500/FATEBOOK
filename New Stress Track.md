## Purity

In addition to the Physical and Mental stress tracks of Fate Core, [SYSTEM NAME] also uses a third stress track, the Purity stress track. This new track represents a Mahou Shoujo's connection to the raw energies that make up their suite of powers.

## Restoring Purity

Purity can be restored in the same manner as the Physical and Mental tracks. Generally, this will be after combat has been ended and the character has had a chance to catch her breath.

In order to preform a restoration spell, firstly the casting Mahou Shoujo must have an Aspect that allows such a spell as detailed on pg [PG NUMBER]. If so, then player must make an Overcome action using Magic Utility vs. a difficulty equal to the Purity box to be healed. If the target currently has been reverted to her ordinary form, the caster has a bonus of (+2) to her roll. If she succeeds

## Purity

In addition to the Physical and Mental stress tracks of Fate Core, [SYSTEM NAME] also uses a third stress track, the Purity stress track. This new track represents a Mahou Shoujo's connection to the raw energies that make up their suite of powers. As such, the Purity stress track can normally only be damaged during combat after the character has transformed into her Mahou Shoujo form. Even so, there are (blessedly) rare instances where the track can be damaged outside of her transformation, representing a particularly virulent and reprehensible evil that gnaws at the very core of the Mahou Shoujo. 

Unlike the Physical and Mental stress tracks, however, a character is not necessarily taken out of a combat when her Purity has been filled. Instead, she is reverted back to her everyday form. This reversion happens regardless of whether or not she has any free consequences available for use, and as such while devoid of her magical powers she can still aid her teammates in combat.

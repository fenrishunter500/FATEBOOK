## A Girl's Work is Never Done

"Grahhh! I can't believe that monster would do this to me!"

"It's your fault for ignoring your coursework, Mizumi-chan." Keiko responds with a wry smirk. "What did you expect from Mrs. Watanabe-sama? Rumor has it she hasn't excused a late homework assignment in the last three decades."

Mizumi puffs her cheeks, the gesture sending her bangs fluttering. "Well... when that thing showed up last night and wrecked part of the city, I guess I thought she'd at least empathize enough to let me work on it another night."

"But Mayumi, you don't even live on that side of the city," the soft spoken Alice pipes in, "You just didn't do it, and hoped to slip through the cracks." 

The other girls all giggle at Mayumi's expense, who quickly moves the conversation along. "Well... it was good that [SOLO MAGICAL GIRL] showed up when she did. Who knows what else would have happened had she not."

Alice shades but a degree redder at the mention of the magical girl, but remains silent. She hadn't told her friends yet of her nighttime activities, in hopes of keeping them safe. Well, safer anyway. The rate of monster appearances these days means that at any moment something could go horribly wrong. 

"What about you, Alice-chan?" Hearing her name, Alice breaks from her reverie. Seeing the confused look on her face, Mayumi repeats herself. "I said, what about you, Alice-chan? Who do you think the famed [SOLO MAGICAL GIRL] is?"

"Oh, that's-" Her answer is cut short by a low, growing rumbling. The sound crescendos before breaking into the sound of twisting metal and crashing concrete. In response, the city-wide alert system begins to blare over the speakers, urging the school girls to quickly find shelter. 

*Oh no, not now...*

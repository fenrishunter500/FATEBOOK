## Creating Opposition

The life of a Mahou Shoujo is fraught with peril. After all, would there even be need of magical girls if there were not threats to humanity needing to be stopped? This section details how to create such opponents as rivals, villains, and monsters with which you can use to stand in the way of your player character's goals.

Enemies are broken down into three major classifications: Minions, Lieutenants, and Bosses. Minions are the everyday grunts of the forces of darkness. These enemies generally do not pose much of a threat unless they attack in large numbers. Lieutenants, on the other hand, can prove to be a legitimate challenge for a Magical Girl on a one-to-one basis. Above them are the Bosses, enemies so powerful that it will take the whole of the team bringing their "A" game in order to bring down. 

## Corruption

Most of the enemies encountered by Mahou Shoujo are servants to the forces of evil. These enemies do not have a Purity Stress Track; instead, they have a Corruption Stress Track. For all intents and purposes, the Corruption Stress Track acts exactly as the Purity Stress Track does, it is just reskinned to represent that their powers come from the forces of evil and darkness as opposed to the forces of good and light that powers the PCs.
In the cases where it doesn't make sense for an opponent to have a Corruption Stress Track, feel free to revert it back to a Purity Stress Track. There are also some enemies who might not have either, in the case of mundane opposition like police officers and the dreaded homeroom teacher!

In addition, [SYSTEM NAME] also attributes to all enemies with a Corruption Stress Track a Corruption Level. This level is determined by their classification. Minions will always have a Corruption Level of 1, unless they are congregated in a large enough group (see below.) Lieutenants' Corruption hovers between 2 and 3 depending on the strength of the Lieutenant. Finally, Bosses have a Corruption Level of 4 or higher. A Boss with a Corruption of 5 is one of the most evil beings across the dimensions, and a Corruption 6 Boss is nearly unheard of. That doesn't mean that such an avatar of evil doesn't exist, however!

## Minions

At the very bottom of any secret cult, invading dimensional or alien army, or evil organization are the Minions. These (comparatively) weak enemies are ideal for filling your scenes without needing to utilize Lieutenants and Bosses. They have the added benefit of allowing your players to feel like the badasses they are as they carve through throngs of enemies without breaking a sweat. 

To build a Minion, first give it a name that describes its function in the schemes of the evil overlord. Things like "Possessed Civilian", "Imp", and "Fledgling Cultist" work well. This name serves as the Minion's sole Aspect. 

Next, decide on the number of skills the Minion possesses from the following list:
 - One Average (+1) skill
 - One Fair (+2) skill
 - One Good (+3) and one Average (+1) skill

You can use skills from the player's skill list, or you can make up skills specific to the Minion. Maybe your "Imp" has an Average (+1) Trickery skill, or the "Fledgling Cultist" a Fair (+2) Cursed Dagger skill. Obviously, these skills become much more narrow and situational than the normal list of skills, but such is the life of a lowly Minion! Similarly, a Minion lacks Stunts of any kind. 

Minions have a number of 1 point stress boxes equal to the highest skill value they possess. A Minion with a Fair (+2) skill has two 1 point stress boxes. In addition, Minions may cross off multiple stress boxes in a single hit, unlike PCs. 

Minions have a Corruption Level of 1. They cannot increase this value outside of congregating in large groups as detailed below.

What makes Minions potentially dangerous is their tendency to group in large numbers. A GM can choose to group a number of Minions into a single enemy. This enemy has the same skills as all of its component Minions. For every two Minions that share a skill, add an Average (+1) bonus to that skill to a maximum of Great (+4).  In addition, the group has a number of stress boxes equal to all of the stress boxes on all Minions that have joined the group. 
A Minion group has a Corruption Level equal to 1 plus the number of minions in the group divided by 4, rounded down. It takes 4 Minions in a group in order to increase the Corruption Level to 2.

## Lieutenants

Further up the chain are Lieutenants. These enemies can be enough to give a single Mahou Shoujo trouble, and at the least be a drain on resources for a team. They are usually seen as one or two accompanying a group of Minions, but sometimes they instead fight side-by-side with a Boss enemy.

Lieutenants come in two main varieties: Tanks and Cannons. As their name suggests, Tanks are able to soak up damage. They may not be able to dish out the sort of damage that Cannons can in a single blow, but leaving them alone is significantly problematic. Conversely, Cannons are able to deal immense damage in one strike, but can be a little fragile. They do not necessarily deal max damage every time, but with the right circumstances they can really hurt the players. 

Both Tanks and Cannons have a High Aspect and a Trouble. If you want to emphasize the Lieutenant's importance, give it a third aspect. Tailor these Aspects so as to emphasize it's size, toughness, or something else relating to why it is so dangerous. Perhaps the Cannon is hard to distinguish from ordinary citizenry, or the Tank is the living embodiment of an immovable object. Make sure to include in there an Achilles' Heel of some kind the players can exploit if they parse out what it is.

For skills, set your Lieutenants's apex skill at one step above the PC's highest-rated skill. If you want the Lieutenant to be especially dangerous, used sparingly you can set the apex skill at two steps above instead. Next, give it two skills rated at one step below it's apex skill. If you plan for a Lieutenant to become integral to the story, or you feel it needs more defining, consider adding a third set of three skills at one step below that. 
Tanks will prioritize skills that aid in survival. Physique, Athletics, and Will are going to be more important than Fight, Shoot, or Provoke. Their raw survival skills can come from their ability to soak damage, or alternatively their ability to avoid attacks altogether. Cannons, on the other hand, are the opposite with a prioritization of offensive skills that deal stress to the players. Cannons also benefit from skills that allow them to focus on mobility or keeping attention off of themselves such as Sneak, Deceive, and Athletics. Be careful not to give a Lieutenant both high soaking abilities and high damaging abilities; if it is both tough and hits hard, it probably serves better as a boss than a Lieutenant.

Lieutenants have one or two stunts. This is where Tanks and Cannons begin to really diverge. Tanks should have stunts that make them a priority to deal with. Consider giving your Tank a stunt that allows it to take an Armor rating, or something that grants extra stress boxes. 
Cannons should have, at the very least, a stunt that grants Weapon:2 on it's primary attack. For an exceptionally dangerous Cannon, consider giving it a stunt that makes it harder to spot as well. 

The following is a list of example stunts for Tanks and Cannons. Some of these may seem powerful for a stunt, and that's ok; in the case of a recurring character they might be. But for an enemy designed to be present only for the duration of combat, they should be fine:

 - Designate a character, place, or object to guard. Whenever that thing
   is attacked and you are in the same zone, you can spend a fate point
   to redirect the attack to yourself. You gain Armor:1 against this
   attack.
 - Gain a Fair (+2) to create advantages with Provoke by fomenting arguments that undermine the PCs or make them look foolish.
 - When you attack with your apex skill, you get Weapon:2.
 - When you defend with your apex skill, you get Armor:2.
 - Twice per session, you can use your apex skill in place of any other
   skill.
 - Once per session, you can attack everyone in a zone with your apex
   skill.
 - Provided you havenâ€™t been spotted by your target yet, you can attack
   with Sneak instead of Fight.
 - By spending a fate point, you can make yourself vanish from the scene
   entirely. Then, at the end of any later turn, you can spend another
   fate point to make yourself reappear anywhere in the scene and
   immediately attack.

When creating a Lieutenant's Stress Tracks, consider what sort of enemy you are creating. A Physical Tank will have a large Physical Stress Track, whereas a Social Tank will have a large Mental Stress Track. All Tanks have at least a Mild Consequence; particularly tough ones will also have a Moderate Consequence.
Cannons will have the bare minimum stress track. For particularly nasty or important Cannons, give them a Mild Consequence slot. Otherwise, Cannons have no Consequences available to them. 

Tanks are there to get into the PCs faces. They are relentless, merciless, and attack with a constant pressure. When a Tank gets taken out, the PCs should feel a wave of relief. Don't play cautiously with these brutes; they exist to soak up punishment and have the ability to do so in stride. 
Most fights should have at least one Tank in them. A single Tank is an easy fight, whereas a climactic encounter might have four or five. Any conflict with a boss should have at least two of them to serve as a buffer, and any fight with a Cannon should include at least one Tank to distract the PCs.
Whereas Tanks are relentless in their assaults, Cannons are patient, opportunistic hunters. Ideally, the PCs initially may not even realize there is a Cannon in the scene. Keep them unseen and unnoticed until they are in position, then strike without remorse. Don't be afraid to use your Fate Points to make the attack count; chances are, once the players know it exists, the Cannon is not going to get a second chance at attack. However, once the PCs focus on the Cannon, don't waste too many resources trying to protect them. Let the PCs feel awesome by taking out such a dangerous foe. 
Don't use Cannons every conflict. A single Cannon means a PC will likely be suffering a consequence. Two means you are putting some serious hurt on your players. Three can easily mean a PC getting taken out. When you do use Cannons, make sure there are other enemies to distract form them. Tanks are perfect for this, but throngs of Minions can do the trick as well. 

## Bosses

Where Lieutenants are specialized enemies and Minions are generic fodder, Bosses are those special enemies at the top of the food chain. These are the guys pulling the strings behind the Big Evil Plot, The driving force behind the current story or arc, and the enemies that the PCs just can't wait to take down. Bosses are a focal point, big personalities that drive the story forward.

Bosses have a full spread of five Aspects. Give your Boss a High Concept that drives home what she is really all about, the core of their being and the key to their involvement in the story. Their Trouble should be something that is a closely guarded secret, something that the players will have to work to discover but can readily use once found out. For the remaining three, come up with unique idiosyncrasies that really define and flesh out your boss, things that make her memorable. 

Rarely are these enemies the leaders that they are due to chance. They have the skills and the abilities to back every evil action they take. Bosses are far more versatile than their Lieutenants, and it is entirely within your purview to make a Boss with both high damage and high damage soaking abilities.
First, take note of the highest-rated PC skill. Give your Boss either one skill two steps higher, or two skills at one step higher, than that rating. If your Boss has a single Apex skill, fill out the next level down with two skills, the next with three skills, and so on down the ladder to Fair (+2). If your Boss has two Apex skills, follow the same process but start with three skills at the next level, down to Fair (+2). All other skills are Average (+1); Bosses do not have the luxury of being Mediocre (+0) in a skill.
Bosses will prioritize skills based on his or her personality. They may be stereotypical, or they may subvert the expectations of your players. 

A Boss will have, at minimum, one stunt, and as many as three. Boss stunts should be memorable, possibly bringing in more enemies, making them harder to deal with, or representative of their social status. Here are some examples:

 - **Connected**: Once per session, you can draw on your contacts to bring
   in reinforcements. These reinforcements take the form of either one
   Cannon with an apex skill rated equal to your Contacts, two Tanks
   with apex skills rated one step lower than your Contacts, or Fair
   (+2) Minions equal in number to your Contacts. When you use this
   stunt, you can spend one fate point to gain +2 to Contacts, to a
   maximum of Great (+4), for the purpose of bringing in these
   reinforcements.
 - **Escape Plan**: Once per session, if you would get taken out, you can
   spend a fate point to concede instead.
 - **Mook Shield**:  Whenever you are attacked, you can spend a fate point
   to divert the attack to nearby Minion enemies.

Bosses have stress tracks of varying lengths based on their skills, but all bosses have at least a Mild and Moderate Consequence Slot. Particularly nasty bosses also have a Severe Consequence Slot.

Ultimately, all Bosses should be memorable, with personalities and goals uniquely their own. To that end, taking out a boss should always be a big deal and probably shouldn't happen every session. Fighting with the Boss frequently might be ok, but be careful with your Bosses; don't be afraid to concede. They are not as disposable as the other types of enemies, so by conceding you can make sure you hold onto them for future confrontations. That being said, don't rob the PC's of their victory against Bosses either. When they do defeat a Boss, make it a big deal and reward them accordingly.

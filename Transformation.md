## Transformations and Transformation Boons

One of the most iconic conventions of the Mahou Shoujo genre is the transformation sequence. Not only are they an excuse to have a visually interesting cut scene, but they also serve to give the viewer a visual clue that things are about to get exciting.

In [SYSTEM NAME], this sequence serves as more than 

1. As the magic swirls and coalesces around you, its residual energies cling protectively to your newly transformed form. Gain a +2 bonus to a single Defend action this combat. 
2. Amidst your transformation, you can feel the magical energies almost begging you to vanquish this evil before you. Gain a +2 bonus to the first Attack action you make this combat.
3. Not only have you been suffused with magical energies, but so too has the environment around you. Gain one free invoke of a Situational Aspect this combat when attempting either a Create an Advantage or Overcome action.
4. The latent energies of your powers has permeated throughout your core, increasing your ability to recover from serious blows. You may lower the severity of a single consequence you have received during this combat from Moderate to Mild.

## New Character Options

Provided here is a list of example Stunts available to a Mahou Shoujo. By no means are you limited to the Stunts listed here and in the Core Rulebook; in fact, we encourage you to come up with your own! Hopefully these will give you some ideas on how to custom tailor Stunts for your own unique character.

**Battlefield Controller**: *A tactician knows that it is more than just raw fighting prowess that allows wars to be won. Precision control of the flow of the battlefield is equally important, if not more so.* You may upgrade a boost to an aspect with one free invoke when using a Create an Advantage action to place a Scene or Situational Aspect. 

**Dedicated Healer**: *The magical energies that come to you when you call are uniquely suited to mending the most severe of wounds.* When you attempt a healing spell, gain a Fair (+2) bonus to your roll as if your target was reverted to normal form. This bonus stacks with the Fair (+2) bonus for healing reverted characters. However, all Magical Attack rolls made by you suffer a Terrible (-2) penalty. 

**Deflection Shot**: *Your skills with magical projectiles are so finely tuned, you figure you could shoot incoming projectiles if you so needed!* You may use your Magical Shoot skill to Defend against projectile attacks. 

**Elemental Affinity**: *Your connection to the Heart of Elements affords you greater protection within your sphere of influence.* Choose any archetypal element (Fire, Water, Air, Earth, Wood, Metal, Ice, etc.) Anytime an opponent makes and Attack action against you using that element, you gain a Fair (+2) bonus to your Defend action. This stunt requires an appropriate Aspect to take (see pg [NUMBER] on Aspects and Magic). 

**Feral Assault:** *Your magic engenders within you a blood-pounding rage that can only be sated when there is no remaining sign of evil in your presence.* Once per combat, you may make two Magical Fight Attack actions on your turn. Until the start of your next turn, any Defend action you take suffers a Terrible (-2) penalty as you throw yourself all in on attacking. 

**Retaliatory Strike**: *The motto "The best defense is a good offense" is more than just a motto for you; it's nigh a way of life when you are one of a few tasked with protecting mankind from the demons that stalk the shadows.* Once per scene, when hit with an Attack action from the Fight or Magic Fight skills, you may immediately inflict a 2 stress hit on your opponent. This strikes comes after you apply any stress taken from your opponent's Attack. 

**Supernatural Senses**: *Where others rely on the raw input of their 5 senses, you have learned to augment your own with the magical energies that fuel your abilities.* You may use Magical Utility instead of Notice when rolling for initiative in combat. 

**Won't You Be My Friend?**: *Friendship, and by extension love, is the strongest force ever conceived. You intend to show this fact to the world.* When you make an Empathy or Rapport roll, gain a Fair (+2) bonus to your roll.

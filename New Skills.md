## New Skills

[SYSTEM NAME] uses the default FATE CORE skill list (FATE CORE, p.97) with the addition of the Magic Fight, Magic Shoot, and Magic Utility skills. 

These skills represent the innate magical properties of a Mahou Shoujo. Just like no two Mahou Shoujo are the same, so too do their powers vary wildly. Within the vast options available to a Mahou Shoujo, however, every spell can be roughly categorized into one of three major fields of effect: Fight, Shoot, or Utility. 

How two Mahou Shoujo decide to utilize these skills can be very different indeed. Whether striking with a summoned blade of fire, attacking with modified claws due to a transformation, or a simple punch augmented by magical energies, all three are represented by the Magic Fight skill. Similarly, a fireball, lightning bolt, magic gun, and eye beam all fall under Magic Shoot. 

	GM NOTE
	GMs, feel free to combine the three types of Magic skills into 
	a single Magic skill if it suits your game better. This is
	especially useful in a low-magic setting, where the Mahou
	Shoujo's powers are not much more than physical augmentations or
	where the girls' training outside of transformation sequences
	is more important. We do not recommend this change for higher
	levels of magic, if only because to have so much governed by a 
	single skill would become broken quickly. That being said, we 
	highly encourage you to take a look at your personal game and
	decide what suits you and your table best.

While Magic Fight and Magic Shoot are fairly self-explanatory, Magic Utility can be a little more tricky. Utility spells are any spell that is not used to directly attack an opponent. If attempting to make an Attack action with magic, either Magic Fight or Magic Shoot should be rolled. Magic Utility, on the other hand, encompasses all attempts at using the Create an Advantage or Overcome actions. Defend actions can be taken with either Magic Fight or Magic Utility depending on the spell (Magic Shoot being too offensively oriented for the task without a proper stunt allowing its use.) 

While each player certainly has narrative control over the magical spells their characters cast, it is ultimately up to the GM to determine which of the three skills the spell falls under. Feel free to dress your spells up as creatively as you wish, but respect the GMs judgement on the matter. Similarly, GMs, we encourage you to work with your players' creativity.

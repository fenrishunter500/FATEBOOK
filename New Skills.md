## New Skills

[SYSTEM NAME] uses the default FATE CORE skill list (FATE CORE, p.97) with the addition of the Magic Fight, Magic Shoot, and Magic Utility skills, collectively referred to as the Magical skills. 

These skills represent the innate magical properties of a Mahou Shoujo. Just like no two Mahou Shoujo are the same, so too do their powers vary wildly. Within the vast options available to a Mahou Shoujo, however, every spell can be roughly categorized into one of three major fields of effect: Fight, Shoot, or Utility. 

How two Mahou Shoujo decide to utilize these skills can be very different indeed. Whether striking with a summoned blade of fire, attacking with modified claws due to a transformation, or a simple punch augmented by magical energies, all three are represented by the Magic Fight skill. Similarly, a fireball, lightning bolt, magic gun, and eye beam all fall under Magic Shoot. 

	GM NOTE
	GMs, feel free to combine the three types of Magic skills into 
	a single Magic skill if it suits your game better. This is
	especially useful in a low-magic setting, where the Mahou
	Shoujo's powers are not much more than physical augmentations or
	where the girls' training outside of transformation sequences
	is more important. We do not recommend this change for higher
	levels of magic, if only because to have so much governed by a 
	single skill would become broken quickly. That being said, we 
	highly encourage you to take a look at your personal game and
	decide what suits you and your table best.

While Magic Fight and Magic Shoot are fairly self-explanatory, Magic Utility can be a little more tricky. Utility spells are any spell that is not used to directly attack an opponent. If attempting to make an Attack action with magic, either Magic Fight or Magic Shoot should be rolled. Magic Utility, on the other hand, encompasses all attempts at using the Create an Advantage or Overcome actions. Defend actions can be taken with either Magic Fight or Magic Utility depending on the spell (Magic Shoot being too offensively oriented for the task without a proper stunt allowing its use.) 

In addition, Magic Utility has uses beyond spellcasting. During the Transformation Phase of combat, a player can make a Magic Utility roll against a difficulty equal to the Corruption level (or Purity, if circumstances call for it) of the highest opponent. If the player succeeds, she may choose one bonus from the list on page [PG NUMBER]. Whenever the Mahou Shoujo is reverts back to her regular form, whether from filling her Purity stress track, the end of combat, or any other special effect or event, this bonus is lost.

	While each player certainly has narrative control over the
	magical spells their characters cast, it is ultimately up to the
	GM to determine which of the three skills the spell falls under.
	Feel free to dress your spells up as creatively as you wish, but
	respect the GMs judgement on the matter. Similarly, GMs, we
	encourage you to work with your players' creativity. If what
	they are attempting is interesting and facilitates fun, go for
	it! 

## Magical Skills and Purity

During character creation, a Mahou Shoujo can gain additional Purity stress boxes depending on her Magical skills. If two or more of her skills (whether Magic Fight, Magic Shoot, or Magic Utility) is rated at Average (+1) or Fair (+2), she gains one additional stress box, or if at Good (+3) or higher she gains two additional stress boxes. 

	Note:
	Similar to how Physique and Will affect Physical and Mental
	Stress respectively, these bonus stress boxes do not stack. For
	example, say a Mahou Shoujo starts the game with a Fair (+2) in
	Magic Fight and Magic Shoot and a Good (+3) in Magic Utility,
	she gains an extra stress box. If she were to increase her 
	Magic Fight to Good (+3) as well, she would only gain a single
	additional stress box, for a cumulative two extra stress boxes.

# FATEBOOK

Welcome! Thank you for your interest in playtesting MAHOU SHOUJO: Wake Up, Go to School, Save the World! 
In here, you will find a number of files contain all of the sections of the core book. Each file is dedicated to
a specific section. Some sections have yet to be written, mainly Gamemaster aids showing how to use common
genre tropes at your gaming table. In addition, you may see page reference numbers that are not currently filled in.
This is because at the moment, I have not moved on to the book formatting step yet.

There is also a section titled "Mechanics". That one is a little misleading, it is more my draft page than anything.
Feel free to poke about in there however, and gain some insight on how the creation process of this game developed!

These sections are not in book order, i.e. there will be some shuffling before the text goes to formatting.
It may take a little hunting to find what you need, but it should be in the appropriate section header.
For the time being, however, this should suffice in giving you all of the raw information you need to 
start playing. 

Feel free to include any input you have and send it to my email at fenrishunter500@gmail.com with the subject line 
"MAHOU SHOUJO PLAYTEST FEEDBACK" so that I can get to it as soon as possible. Please be respectful in your criticisms,
but also please do not hold back any issues you might have. I would like to hear any possible errors
I might have made, and oversights I may have missed, and any mechanics that just plain do not work as intended.

Also feel free to share your sessions, along with any house rules you might have needed to make.
I'd love to hear what you have done with the system!

Thank you again, and I hope you have fun in your adventures as you work together with the power of 
Friendship, Light, and Love to stop the Evil Forces from completing their agenda! 
Happy Gaming!
